# Student-Grade-Relationship
Analysis of factors affecting student performance, including relationship status, family relationship quality, and gender.

## Project Overview
This project investigates how personal factors such as relationship status, family relationship quality, and gender impact student academic performance. The analysis was conducted using SAS.

## Purpose and Goals
The main objective of this project is to explore and understand the relationships between students' academic performance and their personal backgrounds, helping educators identify key factors that may influence student success.

## Data Analysis Methods
- **PROC TABULATE**: Summary statistics for relationship status, family relationship quality, and grades.
- **PROC SGPLOT**: Visualization of grade distributions based on various factors.
- **PROC GLM**: Regression analysis to determine the impact of factors on grades.

## Key Findings
- Students' grades were influenced by relationship status and family relationship quality.
- Gender and relationship status showed interaction effects on final grades.

## Data Description
- **Source**: The dataset includes information on students' grades and personal backgrounds, such as relationship status and family relationship quality.
- **Variables**: Important variables include G3 (final grades), gender, relationship status, and family relationship quality.

## Usage Instructions
To replicate this analysis:
1. Open the `Final Report.pdf` to view the results and findings.
2. Use SAS with the same procedures (PROC TABULATE, PROC SGPLOT, PROC GLM) if you want to replicate or extend the analysis.

## Future Work
- Additional factors, such as extracurricular activities or parental education levels, could be included to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
- Further studies could explore the long-term effects of these personal factors on academic performance over time.

## Files
